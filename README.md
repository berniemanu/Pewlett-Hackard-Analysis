## Summary: 
My analysis helps Pewlett-Hackard navigate the much anticiplated "silver tsunami" with more clarity and planning. Silver tsumai is expected to result in 72,458 employees set to retire.
However there are only 1,549 employees available to mentor next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. Pewlett Hackard may benefit from offering an incentive based mentorship program for extending retirees or make more employees available for mentoring the new employees.
